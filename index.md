# Hello from Victorious Life Church

We are glad that you clicked just the right buttons to get here. Hope this page is informative but in case you need more information feel free to email us

## Who we are:

A group of ordinary people pursuing an extraordinary God, because of something wonderful His son Jesus did. We enjoy each other, we laugh, sometimes we cry, but we always look for God to be involved in our lives.

## What a typical service might look like:

We have simple but powerful worship where we enjoy making God smile. Our pastor's wife usually shares some adventure of the past week and a few prayer points to focus on. We encourage generosity in giving and faithfulness in His tithing. We have monthly communion to remember the life of Jesus. Our pastor shares practical, applicable, and transparent messages that will challenge us to pursue God. At the end of each service there is an opportunity for prayer. We usually end with a few stories in the lobby between meeting new friends. Hope you get a chance to experience this wonderful church.
